1+0+1+1 = 3 Prime

Shaders Implemented: Vertex Coloring, Outlining, Toon and Waves

Why I Implemented what I've implemented:

Vertex Coloring: placeholder lol

Outlining: Making the carts have a visible outline.

Toon: The game should look cartoony as Super Mario Kart is a cartoony game.

Waves: In rainbow road, the track goes up and down.
