Shaders Implemented: Vertex Coloring, Outlining, Toon and Waves

Why I Implemented what I've implemented:

Vertex Coloring: placeholder lol

Outlining: Making the carts/players have a visible outline.

Toon: The game should look cartoony as Super Mario Kart is a cartoony game.

Waves: In rainbow road, the track goes up and down.

Rainbow Texture taken from here: https://www.google.com/search?q=rainbow+texture&rlz=1C1UEAD_enCA1011CA1011&oq=rainbow+texture&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgBEAAYgAQyBwgCEAAYgAQyBwgDEAAYgAQyBwgEEAAYgAQyBwgFEAAYgAQyBwgGEAAYgAQyBwgHEAAYgAQyBwgIEC4YgAQyBwgJEAAYgATSAQgxMTk3ajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#vhid=bnU9wN_FyfREhM&vssid=_Mi1XZ-HlKIDw0PEPvMzykQg_40

Normal Made with Photopea (photoshop alternative)

How I implemented everything:

Vertex Coloring:

Outlining:

Toon:

Waves:

The properties are there because the shader needs to know the main texture, color, scrolling properties such as how fast and how large the waves are.
Next in the subshader category, the program tells the system that I've made my selection on everything before, the program then realizes that this is the texture/material/normal that needs to be put on the object. The plane first starts off with realizing that it needs to move up and down to simulate the look of waves, then the image texture which would be my rainbow is moving from left to right and then the final look is formed.
